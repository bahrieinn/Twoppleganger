A toy app to play around with the Twitter API and writing basic matching algorithms. 

Check it out at: http://twoppleganger.herokuapp.com

If you're a user with a total network (friends + followers) of more than 18K, the app won't be able to find a match since it will hit Twitter API limits. Apologies to the popular people / brands out there.
